### Versioning

#### Deleting  a file 

Suppose we hide the Versioning and then delete the file.

We get  a screen stating that the Bucket is empty. 

However, if we click on the Show button we still see all the files and a Delete marker

To see the file again we can just Delete the Delete marker

### Cross Region replication

We enable Cross region replication on the bucket we need to replicate. To enable it we first need to enable Versioning

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2851%29.png)

Replicate the entire bucket

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2817%29.png)

Set the destination bucket

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28110%29.png)

Create a new IAM role

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png)

We see that Versioning is by default already enabled on the newly created destination S3 bucket 

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2853%29.png)

Existing objects are not copied. Any new files we create will be copied. 

Delete markers and files which are deleted are not replicated
