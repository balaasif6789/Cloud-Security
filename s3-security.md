## Enable Server Side Encryption for S3

One SSE is enabled, only added objects  post the activation will be automatically encrypted, objects added before will have to be encrypted manually.

If afterwards SSE is disabled at the bucket level, even then SSE for the objects created in the previously encrypted bucket will continue to remain encrypted.

## CloudTrail on S3

Amazon S3 is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon S3. CloudTrail captures a subset of API calls for Amazon S3 as events, including calls from the Amazon S3 console and from code calls to the Amazon S3 APIs. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Amazon S3. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in **Event history â€“ from the AWS Website**
